INTRO:
    Git is used to track the files.
     It will maintain multiple versions of the same file.
     It is platform-independent.

2. git add		: to track a file
3. git commit -m "v-1" filename: to commit the file
3. git status		: to check file is tracked or not
4. git log 		: to show commits history
5. git log --oneline	: to show commits history on single line
